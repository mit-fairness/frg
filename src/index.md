Title: MIT Algorithmic Fairness Reading Group

# ![](mit.png "MIT Logo") MIT Algorithmic Fairness Reading Group

The Fairness Reading Group at MIT is a weekly meeting to discuss papers and occasionally hear from other researchers. We intend for the reading group to be relatively low effort, so that you can still understand the paper(s) for the week even if you didnâ€™t read them (although skimming would probably be helpful either way).

<!-- To receive announcements, sign up for the [`pl-readinggroup` mailing list](https://mailman.cs.uchicago.edu/mailman/listinfo/pl-readinggroup). -->

Special thanks to the UChicago PL Reading Group for the [website template](https://uchicago-cs.github.io/plrg/). If you are interested, please sign up on this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BygEF5kBPY-xXz5V2wf8sZfDECh7vtiUtz7hCa2FHUg/edit#gid=0). All are welcome!

<!-- To suggest a paper, [open an issue](https://github.com/uchicago-cs/plrg/issues?q=is%3Aissue) on the Github page. We'll close the issue when we schedule the paper. -->

## Schedule

The Fall 2023 reading group will be organized by [Shuvom Sadhuka](https://shuvom-s.github.io/). Stay tuned for updates!
